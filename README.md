divvy - parallel script runner
=============================

This is a (forking) parallel task runner for Ruby designed to be run in the
foreground (i.e. not a server) with minimum infrastucture components (like redis
or a queue server).

## example

This is a simple and contrived example of a divvy job script. You must define a
class that includes the `Divvy::Parallelizable` module and implement the
`#dispatch` and `#perform` methods. There are also hooks available for tapping
into the worker process lifecycle.

``` ruby
# This is a dance party. We're going to hand out tickets. We need to generate
# codes for each available ticket. Thing is, the ticket codes have to be
# generated by this external ticket code generator service (this part is
# just pretend) and there's a lot of latency involved. We can generate multiple
# ticket codes at the same time by making multiple connections.
require 'divvy'
require 'digest/sha1' # <-- your humble ticket code generator service

class DanceParty
  # The Parallelizable module provides default method implementations and marks
  # the object as following the interface defined below.
  include Divvy::Parallelizable

  # This is the main loop responsible for generating work items for worker
  # processes. It runs in the master process only. Each item yielded from this
  # method is marshalled over a pipe and distributed to the next available
  # worker process where it arrives at the #perform method (see below).
  #
  # In this example we're just going to generate a series of numbers to pass
  # to the workers. The workers just write the number out with their pid and the
  # SHA1 hex digest of the number given.
  def dispatch
    tickets_available = ARGV[0] ? ARGV[0].to_i : 10
    puts "Generating #{tickets_available} ticket codes for the show..."
    (0...tickets_available).each do |ticket_number|
      yield ticket_number
    end
  end

  # The individual work item processing method. Each item produced by the
  # dispatch method is sent to this method in the worker processes. The
  # arguments to this method must match the arity of the work item yielded
  # from the #dispatch method.
  #
  # In this example we're given a Fixnum ticket number and asked to produce a
  # code. Pretend this is a network intense operation where you're mostly
  # sleeping waiting for a reply.
  def perform(ticket_number)
    ticket_sha1 = Digest::SHA1.hexdigest(ticket_number.to_s)
    printf "%5d %6d %s\n" % [$$, ticket_number, ticket_sha1]
    sleep 0.150 # fake some latency
  end

  # Hook called after a worker process is forked off from the master process.
  # This runs in the worker process only. Typically used to re-establish
  # connections to external services or open files (logs and such).
  def after_fork(worker)
    # warn "In after_fork for worker #{worker.number}"
  end

  # Hook called before a worker process is forked off from the master process.
  # This runs in the master process only. This can be used to monitor the rate
  # at which workers are being created or to set a starting process state for
  # the newly forked process.
  def before_fork(worker)
    # warn "In before_fork for worker #{worker.number}"
  end
end
```

### divvy command

You can run the example script above with the `divvy` command, which includes
options for controlling concurrency and other cool stuff. Here we use five
worker processes to generate 10 dance party ticket codes:

```
$ divvy -n 5 danceparty.rb
51589        0 b6589fc6ab0dc82cf12099d1c2d40ab994e8410c
51590        1 356a192b7913b04c54574d18c28d46e6395428ab
51589        4 1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a
51590        5 ac3478d69a3c81fa62e60f5c3696165a4e5e6ac4
51591        2 da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0
51589        6 c1dfd96eea8cc2b62785275bca38ac261256e278
51592        3 77de68daecd823babbb58edb1c8e14d7106e83bb
51590        8 fe5dbbcea5ce7e2988b8c69bcfdfde8904aabc1f
51591        9 0ade7c2cf97f75d009975f4d720d1fa6c19f4897
51593        7 902ba3cda1883801594b6e1b452790cc53948fda
```

The columns of output are the worker pid, the ticket number input, and the
generated ticket code result. You can see items are distributed between
available workers evenly-ish and may not be processed in order.

### manual runner

You can also turn the current ruby process into a divvy master by creating a
`Divvy::Master` object, passing an instance of `Parallelizable` and the amount
of desired concurrency:

``` ruby
require 'danceparty'
task = DanceParty.new
master = Divvy::Master.new(task, 10)
master.run
```
